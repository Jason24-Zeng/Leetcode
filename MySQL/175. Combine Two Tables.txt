Write a SQL query for a report that provides the following information for each person in the Person table, regardless if there is an address for each of those people:

FirstName, LastName, City, State


My Solution:
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select FirstName, LastName, City, State # Target columns
from Person left join Address # left join because we don't neccesarry need Adress information if we have information in Person
on Person.PersonID = Address.PersonID # Match the information in between the two table
;
