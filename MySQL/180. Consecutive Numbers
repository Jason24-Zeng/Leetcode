Write a SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

+----+-----+
| Id | Num |
+----+-----+
| 1  |  1  |
| 2  |  1  |
| 3  |  1  |
| 4  |  2  |
| 5  |  1  |
| 6  |  2  |
| 7  |  2  |
+----+-----+
For example, given the above Logs table, 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.

+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+

# Write your MySQL query statement below
with table1 as 
(Select L1.Id, L1.Num as anum, L2.Num as bnum, L3.Num as cnum from Logs L1
join Logs L2 on L1.Id + 1 = L2.Id
join Logs L3 on L1.Id + 2 = L3.Id
)
select distinct anum as 'ConsecutiveNums' from table1 where anum = bnum and anum = cnum
