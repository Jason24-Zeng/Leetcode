# Leetcode

# As a beginner of algorithm programming, I am trying to strengthen my coding skill and arm myself with information-based tools. By using Github to store my progress on Leetcode would be definitely helpful for my willpower on learning programming, and I believe it kind of build me a good habit to monitor my future project. Wish Light Blessed me.
